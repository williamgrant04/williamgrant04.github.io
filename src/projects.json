    "description": "The Guild was a project I worked on in Le Wagon alongside 3 other developers in a 2-week timespan. It is a platform for gaming guild management, allowing users to create and manage their guild members in one platform eliminating the need for multiple platforms. It features a live chat and a calendar to show events."

It's a platform for renting services from other users, it is named rent-a-peer because we thought it was funny. As our first project it's not very polished."
